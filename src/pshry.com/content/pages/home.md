<p class="font-size_150">I live and work remotely in New Jersey, with my wife, <a href="https://jessicawalch.com">Jess</a>. I'm currently a WordPress Engineer at the <a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA</a>, where I develop digital products for the league, as well as for the <a href="https://www.wnba.com/">WNBA</a>, <a href="https://gleague.nba.com/">G League</a>, and <a href="https://2kleague.nba.com/">2k League</a>. I'm also a part-time Web Developer at <a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir</a>, maintaining their public-facing marketing site.</p>

Previously, I led front end development on the Visual Communications team at [Realogy](https://www.realogy.com/), where I built internal and public-facing websites and apps for corporate teams and served leading real estate brands like [Coldwell Banker](https://www.coldwellbanker.com/), [Sotheby's](https://www.sothebysrealty.com), and [Century&nbsp;21](https://www.century21.com/). Some other clients I've worked for include [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/), [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/), [GlaxoSmithKline](https://us.gsk.com/en-us/home/), [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/), [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/), and [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/).

## Diverse Experience and Skill Set

I've helped Fortune 500 industry leaders, award-winning global agencies, and successful small businesses build accessible, secure websites and applications [since 2009](/resume/).

My background is firmly rooted in design, having spent many years doubling as a graphic designer. I have often handled designing print marketing collateral in addition to designing and developing digital projects for clients with lean teams.
