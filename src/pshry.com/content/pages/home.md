I work remotely from New Jersey. I've helped Fortune 500 industry leaders, award-winning global agencies, and successful small businesses build accessible, secure websites and applications [since 2009](/resume/).

Currently I'm a WordPress Engineer at the [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), where I develop digital products for the league, as well as for the [WNBA](https://www.wnba.com/), [G League](https://gleague.nba.com/), and [2k League](https://2kleague.nba.com/). I'm also a part-time Web Developer at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), maintaining their public-facing marketing site.

Before this, I led front end development on the Visual Communications team at [Realogy](https://www.realogy.com/), where I built internal and public-facing websites and apps for both corporate teams and leading real estate brands like [Coldwell Banker](https://www.coldwellbanker.com/) and [Century&nbsp;21](https://www.century21.com/).
